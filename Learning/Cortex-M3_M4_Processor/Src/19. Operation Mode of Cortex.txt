================
Oprerational mode of the processor
==================================
M0/M3/M4

Processor gives 2 operational modes
1. Thread mode

2. Handler mode

- All your application code will excute under "Thread mode" of the processor. This is also called as "User Mode"
- All the exceptions handle or interrupt handles will run under the "Handler mode" of the processor.
- Processor always start with "Thread mode"
- Wherever the core meets with the system exception or any external interrupts then the core will change its mode to handle
mode to service the ISR associated with that system exception or the interrupt.
